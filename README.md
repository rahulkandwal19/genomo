# genomo
It is an academic project to analyze pathogen threats utilizing DNA-sequence based pathogen network and computing algorithms

# What Genomo Can Do
- Compare DNA of a new pathogen to existing zoonotic strains.
- Build a graph showing similarities between sequences.
- Trace the shortest path to known threats using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- Score and display possible zoonotic risks in a clean web dashboard.
- Help researchers quickly identify how dangerous a new pathogen might be.


# Repository Details
All the source code for the web frontend, backend, algorithms, and support tools are kept in a single repository. 

The system is designed for easy use. 
On Windows (x64), simply run Server.exe in the project root to start the app at localhost:18080—no setup needed.
For other operating systems, compile server.cpp and run the generated executable. Make sure to manually set up any dependencies if its other than x64.
